# movie_rating_analysis

In this comprehensive analysis, I scrutinized the movie rating practices across various platforms, with a primary focus on Fandango. I delved into potential rating disparities, evaluating whether Fandango's ratings are notably higher compared to other renowned sources like Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, and IMDb. By leveraging data visualization techniques such as scatterplots, KDE plots, and clustermaps, I uncovered distinct patterns in the distribution of ratings. The analysis unveiled Fandango's consistent tendency to assign higher ratings, which became more evident when considering their practice of rounding up ratings. The examination of the top 10 worst-rated movies magnified these disparities, prompting crucial insights into rating inconsistencies. As a result, the analysis highlights pertinent considerations concerning rating transparency and accuracy, emphasizing the wider impact of ratings on consumer decisions. Ultimately, this project sheds light on the importance of maintaining reliable and equitable rating systems across industries.
